# Covid-19 Statistics in US in 2020
This project includes two maps showing the distribution of covid-19 counts and case rates(case/thousand residents) in the US in 2020. Covid data is collected from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv). County boundary data is collected from [The U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html).

This is a [link](https://qirunj.github.io/covidmap.github.io/map1.html) to map1, US covid-19 cases in 2020. A screenshot is also provided below. It is a proportional symbols map made using libraries from mapbox and google fonts. The circles represent the number of cases in each city. Darker and larger circles means more cases. As you zoom in and out of the page, the radius of the circle will change accordingly. You can also click on any circle to see the exact cases.
